Hi Everyone!

I have been slowly growing the cancer research resources, what to do with a gene list, and general bioinformatics resources pages since I created the website, please check them out!

I'm also happy to announce that we have hit >1,200 users! I'm glad that so many people have been using the resources and hopefully they enabled you to gain further insight into your data!

Earlier this year, I also launched the [Wales Cancer Bioinformatics Network (WCBN)](https://walescancerresearchcentre.org/wales-cancer-bioinformatics-network/) with aims to connect researchers and bioinformaticians in Wales to facilitate collaboration and networking. 
If you are a bioinformatician or cancer researcher in Wales and would like to join, please follow the link!
