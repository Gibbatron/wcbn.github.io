I hope everyone is enjoying and benefitting from the resources on this website! I have added two new resources: Rummagene and RegNetwork.

The weekly bioinformatics club meetings have been going great and we are picking up traction and gaining new members week-by-week! If you would like to join us for a chit-chat about bioinformatics or life in general, please send me an email (GibbsA@cardiff.ac.uk).

The next update will probably be in the new year, so I hope everyone has a lovely Christmas and Happy New Year!
