title: We made a webpage!

---

After our first bioinformatics club meeting, we agreed that making a github page for the group would be a good idea. This page will allow users to have their own section to upload their own data, such as scripts, learning materials, and resources. 

So far we have Alex, who will be uploading lists of cancer resources, cancer analysis tools, and cancer atlases, as well as links for what to do with your gene list.

this needs to be updated
